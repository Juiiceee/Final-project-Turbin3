# 🤝 Trusted - Direct Funding Platform for Charitable Projects 💧

## Description 🌟

**Trusted** is a transparent charitable platform that enables direct project funding without relying on NGOs. No more wondering where your money goes! 🎯 With **Trusted**, you support tangible projects with full visibility on fund utilization.

## How It Works 🔍

1. **Project Submission** 📝  
   For example, someone wants to build a well in Africa. They contact local companies and obtain quotes for each phase of the project (construction, materials, etc.).

2. **Smart Contract Creation** 🛠️  
   After listing all the companies and associated costs, they submit this information to a **smart contract factory**. Each project becomes a smart contract.

3. **Collaborative Funding** 💰  
   Platform users, whether individuals or businesses, can browse available projects, view detailed quotes, and choose which one they want to fund using crypto. If they like a project, they can contribute directly.

4. **Goal Achievement** 🎯  
   Once the total required amount is raised, the smart contract automatically transfers the funds to the companies listed in the quote.

5. **NFT Receipt** 🎁  
   Each contributor receives a unique **NFT** with details of their donation, such as the amount, serving as proof of their charitable contribution. This NFT can potentially be used for tax exemption purposes 🏦.
